# Bistro Boss | Frontend

Due to my studies, I was on a long break from coding. As a result, I forgot almost everything. So I did this practice project to recap my web development knowledge once again. This is a website of an imaginary restaurant named **Bistro Boss**. You can order food from here or book a table at the restaurant and pay for your orders and bookings.
